# Music with Selenium
This project is a Python script that leverages the Selenium WebDriver to automate music video searches on YouTube. 
By simply inputting the name of a song, the script navigates to YouTube, conducts a search, and automatically plays the first video result. 
This script is particularly useful for users looking to streamline their music video search process on YouTube, allowing for an efficient and hands-off approach to music discovery.

## Features:
- Automates the process of searching for a song on YouTube.
- Plays the first search result video automatically.
- Accepts multiple song names for back-to-back automated search and play.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- ChromeDriver compatible with your Chrome version

### Setup and Execution:
1. Ensure Python and Selenium WebDriver are installed on your system.
2. Place the ChromeDriver executable in the specified directory within the script.
3. Run the script via terminal or command prompt: python3 <script_name>.py
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the number of songs and their names.

This script streamlines music video searches on YouTube through web automation.
